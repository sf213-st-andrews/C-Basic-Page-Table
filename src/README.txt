Instructions:
    Makefile:
        make all will compile all the files.
        make starter will compile files into the ./test executable. 
        make check will compile my primary testing file, into the ./check executable.
        make experiment will compile my experimenting file into the ./experiment executable.
    
    Executable(s):
        ./test:
            It is mostly unaltered from the starter code provided.
        
        ./check:
            This executable will preform tests.
            ./check <number>    will preform a single test, determined by the number. The test number can be {1...X}

        ./experiment:
            This executable I used to determine how things worked. How bitwise operations work.
